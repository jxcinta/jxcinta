- ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Jacinta
- I've worked as a machine learning engineer for the last two years, and I graduated with a Masters's in Physics.
- My work here is all the projects I've worked on - ranging from projects I completed at uni, to personal projects I've undertaken to improve my understanding.
- Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š
