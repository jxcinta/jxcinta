- ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Jacinta
- I've worked as a machine learning engineer for the last two years, and I graduated with a Masters's in Physics. I also have developed web apps (Javascript, React) and I hope to include some extra projects that demonstrate those skills.
- My work here are projects ranging from projects I completed at uni, to personal projects I've undertaken to improve my understanding.
- Some projects are from earlier days when I knew less about programming, and the more recent projects like the fast rcnn object detection repo demonstrates my current skills.
- Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š
